App to play werewolves with friends on your pc/big monitor

I made this app to play werewolves the cardgame with my friends

The idea is to add roles and players to a .txt file. with these files you can start a game of werewolves.
The roles and the players need to be equal to start a game. So the app is not able to play with a thief yet.(He can choose between 2 roles)

At the gamescreen you can submitnames. When the right name is submitted, The role gets shown on a sreen. The idea is to connect a laptop to
a projector or tv screen. 

This way werewolves can be played without the storyteller walking around to show cards.

At the start the roles have to be shown to the designated player while everyone else is closing there eyes.
